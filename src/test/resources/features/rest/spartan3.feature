Feature: Spartan API Single Data
  As a user,
  I should be able to get individual data
  using valid id and see details, update the value
  or delete the whole data

  Background:
    Given the base_uri and base_path set

    @database
  Scenario: Should be able to get single spartan using /spartans/{id}
    And I have valid spartan id
    And I ask for "json" response payload
    When I send get request to "/spartans/{id}" endpoint
    Then I should get status code 200
#    Then the spartan data with that id should match the value in the database
